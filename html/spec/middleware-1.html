<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The [OWIN] specification was created to decouple web servers and web
applications on .NET platforms by creating a standardised abstract signature
that can be implemented by Applications and Servers in a vendor-neutral fashion.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/net_arch_styles.htm#sec_3_4_2">Layering</a> components conforming to a uniform interface
is a natural architectural style for HTTP-based application, and many
application frameworks provide such abstractions in the form of reusable
software components.</p>
<p>This specification provides a standardised signature for such components in the
OWIN ecosystem, hereby referred to as <strong>Middleware</strong>.</p>
<p>OWIN Middleware is defined in terms of a delegate structure building upon the
OWIN: Open Web Server Interface for .NET [Owin 1.0], with no
dependency on external libraries.</p>
<h3 id="1-1-requirements-notation">1.1. Requirements Notation</h3>
<p> The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;, &quot;SHOULD&quot;,
&quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be
interpreted as described in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC 2119</a>.</p>
<p>A component is deemed to be compliant with this specification if all absolute
requirements and prohibitions are conformed to.</p>
<p>Components and terms defined in this and other specifications are always
capitalized, so as to clarify between a general term and the term as used in a
specification.</p>
<h2 id="2-definitions">2. Definitions</h2>
<p>This document refers to the following terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Application</strong>: a process or operation inspecting, modifying or otherwise
accessing HTTP messages, as an AppFunc signature.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Middleware</strong>: Pass through components, capable of mediating request and
response messages, in a pipeline model which, when
composed, forms an Application.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Builder</strong>: The extension point lambda used by developers to add Middleware
components to a pipeline.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Server</strong>: As per the OWIN specification, an HTTP server that directly
communicates with the client, and uses OWIN semantics to process requests.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>
Versions previous to owin 1.0.1 made a distinction between server and host
components. This was later merged as the separation in responsibility was not
relevant to the owin specifications. <strong>Host</strong> and <strong>Server</strong> are considered
equivalent. See <a href="owin-spec">the Owin Specification 1.0.1</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="3-middleware">3. Middleware</h2>
<p>An OWIN Application (see <a href="owin-spec-appfunc">AppFunc</a>) can be modelled as
Middleware components layered in a pipeline.</p>
<p>Each Middleware receiving a request may perform some processing on the request,
may forward the request to the next Middleware and return the resulting
response, or may decide to return a response immediately and not call the rest
of the chain.</p>
<p>In other words, a Middleware functions as a proxy of sort, completely
encapsulating and hiding the next Middleware in the chain, transparently to the
caller.</p>
<h3 id="3-1-examples">3.1. Examples</h3>
<p>For example, a Middleware responsible for logging all requests and responses
could execute as the first component of a pipeline, and log all requests and
responses as they pass through.</p>
<pre><code>        request      &gt; (log request)      &gt; (process request)
SERVER =============== LOGGER ============= WEB APPLICATION
        response     &lt; (log response)     &lt; (return response)
</code></pre><p>Other types of Middleware would respond immediately, without calling the next
component in the pipeline, such as for an authorization module denying a request
before a web application can respond.</p>
<pre><code>        request      &gt; (authenticate)
SERVER =============== LOGGER ------X------ WEB APPLICATION
        response     &lt; (deny)
</code></pre><h3 id="3-2-middleware-operation">3.2. Middleware Operation</h3>
<p>The whole set of Middleware composing an Application are first chained together
in a pipeline in a composition phase. The result of Middleware composition is an
Application (OWIN AppFunc).</p>
<p>A Server as defined by OWIN will call the resulting Application, unaware of the
composition of the pipeline it is calling.</p>
<p>At compose time, each Middleware is passed a reference to the next Middleware in
the chain, and should return an Application.</p>
<p>At run time, a Middleware can inspect and manipulate HTTP messages using the
usual environment dictionary, and in by doing so leverages existing knowledge in
building OWIN-compliant components.</p>
<h3 id="3-3-signature">3.3. Signature</h3>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">using MidFunc = Func&lt;
                     AppFunc, // next Middleware in the chain
                     AppFunc // returns the resulting application
                    &gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="3-4-code-sample">3.4. Code Sample</h3>
<p>The following example is a Middleware logging the request and response headers.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">// MidFunc
public static AppFunc LogMiddleware(AppFunc nextMiddleware)
{
  AppFunc composedApplication = async environment =&gt; {

    // log the request headers
    Log.RequestHeaders(environment[&quot;owin.RequestHeaders&quot;]);

    // pass the request to the next Middleware
    await next(environment);

    // log the response headers
    Log.RequestHeaders(environment[&quot;owin.ResponseHeaders&quot;]);

  }

  return composedApplication;
}
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>This specification does not preclude alternative modeling of the Middleware
functionality from being provided
by vendors (e.g. object-oriented model, procedural, or separate before/after
functions), but they MUST provide a way to expose such alternate representations
as a MidFunc-compatible function.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="4-middleware-registration">4. Middleware Registration</h2>
<p>The component responsible for producing the Application needs to be aware of all
registered Middleware.</p>
<p>In order to provide for capability discovery, configuration and shared
initialisation, this specification introduces a factory function, taking as a
parameter the Startup properties as defined by the
<a href="http://owin.org/spec/owin-1.0.1-draft.1.md">OWIN specification</a>, and a builder function accepting that factory
as a parameter.</p>
<h3 id="4-1-signature">4.1. Signature</h3>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">using MidFactory = Func&lt;
                        IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt;, // startup properties
                        MidFunc // returns the Middleware to use
                       &gt;;
using BuildFunc = Action&lt;
                         MidFactory // the factory for a middleware
                        &gt;;
</code></pre>
<h4 id="4-1-1-registration-sample">4.1.1. Registration Sample</h4>
<p>The following example adds the <code>LogMiddleware</code> component defined earlier and
registers it with the Builder.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">// as previously defined
public static AppFunc LogMiddleware(AppFunc next) { /*  ... */ }

// Definition of the factory
public static MidFunc ConfigureLogMiddleware(IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt; startupProperties)
{
  // optionally read and write to the startup properties
  return LogMiddleware;
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="4-2-discovery-and-registration-of-middleware">4.2. Discovery and Registration of Middleware</h3>
<p>A common requirement for Middleware authors is to enable users to discover
Middleware after installing a software package in their Application.</p>
<p>In order to deliver this functionality, a Middleware MUST implement an extension
method defined for the Builder function.</p>
<p>Integrated development environments tend to provide API discovery in the form of
graphical navigators. As functions usually have a few other members defined, and
to allow easier navigation, a Middleware SHOULD prefix the extension method with
<code>Use</code>, and SHOULDN&#39;T include the word Middleware.</p>
<p>As an Application is often composed of many Middleware components, authors
SHOULD return the BuildFunc in their extension method, to allow for easy
chaining.</p>
<h4 id="4-2-1-extension-method-sample">4.2.1. Extension Method Sample</h4>
<p>Building on previous examples, the following defines the extension method for
the logging Middleware.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">// as previously defined
public static AppFunc LogMiddleware(AppFunc next) { /*  ... */ }
public static MidFunc ConfigureLogMiddleware(IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt; startupProperties) { /* ... */ }

// definition of the Builder extension method
public static BuildFunc UseHeaderLogging(this BuildFunc builder)
{
  builder(ConfiguereLogMiddleware);
  // unfolded to:
  // builder(startupProperties =&gt; ConfigureLogMiddleware(startupProperties));
  // builder(startupProperties =&gt; LogMiddleware);
  return builder;
}

// usage
public static void ConfigureWebApplication(BuildFunc builder)
{
  builder.UseHeaderLogging();
}
</code></pre>
